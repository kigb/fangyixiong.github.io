I am 20 years old, fourth year undergraduate student at SJTU, majored in software engineering. 
I am currently working on Large Language Models in the field of multi-modalities, code generation and prompt engineering.
Moreover, I am also interested in Database development and looking forward to learning more about AI infrastructure.
